In this paper, physical layer security issue for a down-link wireless communication system is examined, composed of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a legitimate receiver and a passive eavesdropper. The destination is equipped with two antennas and applies the full-duplex (FD) Bob-based jamming (FD-BBJ) strategy to achieve secure transmission. Considering that practical air-to-ground (A2G) channels experience Nakagami-$m$ fading and the FD legitimate receiver is affected by self-interference (SI),  closed-form expressions of approximate ergodic achievable secrecy rate (EASR) with help of Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature (GLQ) and compact secrecy outage probability (SOP) expression are derived, respectively. To gain more insights, asymptotic secrecy performance is analysed in the case of extreme total system transmit power, via deriving closed-form expression for asymptotic EASR and compact expression for asymptotic SOP. Numerical results have verified the correctness of our theoretical analysis and proved that the FD-BBJ strategy applied in the UAV-aided wireless communication system can help achieve considerable secrecy performance gain.'
