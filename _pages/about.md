I earned my PhD degree in Telecommunications from King's College London (KCL), doing interdisciplinary research on **wireless communications**, **deep reinforcement learning** and **quantum mechanics**, which commenced on Oct. 2019 and ended on July 2022. For gaining a clearer intuition, the track record amid my PhD can be found in the [Publication page](publications). The title of my PhD thesis is [*On UAVs for Wireless Communications: Resource Management, Performance Analysis and Trajectory Optimization*](PhD_Thesis), while that of my MEng is [*On Enhancing Secrecy Performance for Wireless Communications via Artificial Noise*](MEng_Thesis). Note that the aforementioned performance optimisation and analysis for wireless transmission networks are conducted on **Python** and **MATLAB**, with the help of cutting-edge quantum-aided deep reinforcement learning and conventional mathematical techniques, respectively. 
My current research interests include 6G networks, cloud radio access networks (C-RANs), distributed ultra-large-scale MIMO, fronthaul quantization, radio resource management, IoT, UAV, deep reinforcement learning and quantum AI. 

I have been serving as *reviewer* for various international journals' and conferences' peer-review process since 2018, inter alia, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, IEEE Journal on Selected Aera of Communications, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, IEEE Global Communications Conference and IEEE International Conference on Communications. Besides, 
I was a *session chair* for the flag-ship conference IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2022 - Selected Area on Communications (SAC) 05 - Machine Learning for Communications Track - Networks. During my PhD, I have also participated in several teaching activities within Faculty of Natural, Mathematical & Engineering Sciences, KCL, e.g., 5CCE2MCT Mechatronics (21~22 SEM2 000001), 7CCSMMPC Mobile & Personal Communications (20~21 SEM2 000001) and 7CCEMDCO Digital Communications, where I served as *Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA)* for module leaders to a broad range of audiences, i.e., undergraduates and MScs.

Apart from academia, I am an active *Kaggler*, with hands-on experience of projects requiring vast and solid knowledge of data science and machine learning. Besides, I have been playing a part-time role of *Special Education Consultant* since 2019 for United Kingdom Education Centre (UKEC), offering analysis, insights, advice and career plans to clients for helping them apply for PhD positions and financial fundings.
