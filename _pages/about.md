I earned my PhD degree in Telecommunications from King's College London, which commenced from Oct. 2019 and ended on July 2022. The title of my PhD thesis is "*On UAVs for Wireless Communications: Resource Management, Performance Analysis and Trajectory Optimization*", while that of my MEng is "*On Enhancing Secrecy Performance for Wireless Communications via Artificial Noise*". My current research interests include 6G networks, radio resource management, IoT, UAV, deep reinforcement learning and quantum AI. 

I am also working as a reviewer for journals' peer-review progress, e.g., *IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications*, *IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems*, *IEEE Journal on Selected Aera of Communications* and *IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology*.

Apart from academia, I am also an active Kaggler, with hands-on experience of data science and machine learning, e.g., Pandas, Tensorflow/Pytorch, Scipy, Sklearn and Searborn.

Therefore, my technical expertise covers **wireless communications** and **machine learning**.
