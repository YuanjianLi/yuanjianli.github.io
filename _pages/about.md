I earned my PhD degree at King's College London, Oct. 2019 - July 2022. My current research interests include 6G networks, radio resource management, IoT, UAV, deep reinforcement learning and quantum AI. 

I am also working as a reviewer for journals' peer-review progress of IEEE, e.g., IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, IEEE Journal on Selected Aera of Communications.

Apart from academia, I am also an active Kaggler, with hands-on experience of data science and machine learning.
