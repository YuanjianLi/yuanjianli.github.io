My interdisciplinary research focuses on **AI for Next-Generation Wireless Systems**. 

Two zoomed-in examples are

- Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-enabled joint computation and communication resource coordination for many-UAV many-user multi-access edge computing (MEC) in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios.
- Machine learning (ML)-aided sparsity-aware channel estimation and efficient receiver design for Terahertz (THz) ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) transmissions, where near-field communication characteristics are highlighted.

Broadly speaking, my research expertise and interests include

1. THz UM-MIMO Transmissions
1. Near-Field Communications
1. DRL-Driven Joint Communication and Computation Resource Management 
1. Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks
1. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for Next-Generation Wireless Systems
1. Secure and Covert Communications

> I have authored over *20 papers* in the **interdisciplinary** research direction of wireless communications and signal processing, machine learning, and quantum computing, in top-tier journals and prestigious conferences including IEEE TWC, IEEE TCOM, IEEE WCL, IEEE GLOBECOM, and IEEE ICC. I am also an active **reviewer** for these journals, conferences and beyond. I have authored **9 CN patents** in the fields of wireless communications and signal processing. I served as a **session chair** for IEEE ICC 2022: Selected Areas in Communications: Machine Learning for Communications Track - Networks.

<!--I earned my PhD degree in Telecommunications from King's College London (KCL), doing interdisciplinary research on **wireless communications**, **deep reinforcement learning** and **quantum mechanics**, which commenced on Oct. 2019. For gaining a clearer intuition, the track record amid my PhD can be found in the [Publication page](publications). The title of my PhD thesis is [*On UAVs for Wireless Communications: Resource Management, Performance Analysis and Trajectory Optimization*](PhD_Thesis), while that of my MEng is [*On Enhancing Secrecy Performance for Wireless Communications via Artificial Noise*](MEng_Thesis). Note that the aforementioned performance optimisation and analysis for wireless transmission networks are conducted on **Python** and **MATLAB**, with the help of cutting-edge quantum-aided deep reinforcement learning and conventional mathematical techniques, respectively. -->

<!--My current research interests include 6G networks, cloud radio access networks (C-RANs), distributed ultra-large-scale MIMO, fronthaul quantization, radio resource management, IoT, UAV, deep reinforcement learning and quantum AI. 
-->
<!--I have been serving as *reviewer* for various international journals' and conferences' peer-review process since 2018, inter alia, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, IEEE Journal on Selected Aera of Communications, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, IEEE Global Communications Conference and IEEE International Conference on Communications. Besides, 
I was a *session chair* for the flag-ship conference IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2022 - Selected Area on Communications (SAC) 05 - Machine Learning for Communications Track - Networks. During my PhD, I have also participated in several teaching activities within Faculty of Natural, Mathematical & Engineering Sciences, KCL, e.g., 5CCE2MCT Mechatronics (21~22 SEM2 000001), 7CCSMMPC Mobile & Personal Communications (20~21 SEM2 000001) and 7CCEMDCO Digital Communications, where I served as *Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA)* for module leaders to a broad range of audiences, i.e., undergraduates and MScs. 

Apart from academia, I am an active *Kaggler*, with hands-on experience of projects requiring vast and solid knowledge of data science and machine learning. Besides, I have been playing a part-time role of *Special Education Consultant* since 2019 for United Kingdom Education Centre (UKEC), offering analysis, insights, advice and career plans to clients for helping them apply for PhD positions and financial fundings. -->
