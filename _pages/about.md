I earned my PhD degree in Telecommunications from King's College London (KCL), which commenced from Oct. 2019 and ended on July 2022. The title of my PhD thesis is "*On UAVs for Wireless Communications: Resource Management, Performance Analysis and Trajectory Optimization*", while that of my MEng is "*On Enhancing Secrecy Performance for Wireless Communications via Artificial Noise*". My current research interests include 6G networks, radio resource management, IoT, UAV, deep reinforcement learning and quantum AI. Note that the aforementioned performance analysis and optimisation for wireless transmission networks are conducted on **MATLAB** and **Python**, with the help of conventional mathematical techniques and cutting-edge quantum-aided deep reinforcement learning, respectively. Therefore, my technical expertise covers **Wireless Communications**, **Machine Learning** and **Quantum Mechanics**. 


I have been serving as reviewer for journals' peer-review process since 2018, inter alia, *IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications*, *IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems*, *IEEE Journal on Selected Aera of Communications* and *IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology*. Besides, 
I was a *session chair* for the flag-ship conference IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2022 - Selected Area on Communications (SAC) 05 - Machine Learning for Communications Track - Networks. Amid my PhD, I have also participated in several teaching activities within Faculty of Natural, Mathematical & Engineering Sciences, KCL, e.g., 5CCE2MCT Mechatronics (21~22 SEM2 000001) and 7CCSMMPC Mobile & Personal Communications (20~21 SEM2 000001), where I served as *Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA)* for module leaders to a broad range of audiences, i.e., undergraduates and MScs.

Apart from academia, I am an active Kaggler, with hands-on experience of projects requiring deep knowledge of data science and machine learning. Besides, I have been playing a part-time role of *Special Education Consultant* since 2019 for United Kingdom Education Centre (UKEC), offering analysis, insights, advice and career plans to clients for helping them apply for PhD positions and financial fundings.
