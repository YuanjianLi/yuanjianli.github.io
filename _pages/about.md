My interdisciplinary research focuses on **AI for Next-Generation Wireless Systems**. My long-term goal is to build an **Ecosystem of AI and Wireless**.

Two zoomed-in examples are

- Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-enabled joint computation and communication resource coordination for many-UAV many-user multi-access edge computing (MEC) in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios.
- Model-driven machine learning (ML)-aided sparsity-aware channel estimation and efficient receiver design for Terahertz (THz) ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) transmissions, where near-field communication characteristics are highlighted.

Broadly speaking, my research expertise and interests include

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Native Sixth-Generation (6G) Wireless Systems
1. Internet of Intelligent Things (IoT)
2. Non-Terrestrial Communications (e.g., Drone-Aided Networks)
1. (Scalable/Multi-Agent) DRL-Driven Joint Communication and Computation Resource Management for Multi-Access Edge Computing
1. Compressive Sensing (CS)- and Machine Learning (ML)-Aided Channel Estimation for THz UM-MIMO Systems
2. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for Next-Generation Wireless Systems
1. Secure and Covert Communications

<!--I earned my PhD degree in Telecommunications from King's College London (KCL), doing interdisciplinary research on **wireless communications**, **deep reinforcement learning** and **quantum mechanics**, which commenced on Oct. 2019. For gaining a clearer intuition, the track record amid my PhD can be found in the [Publication page](publications). The title of my PhD thesis is [*On UAVs for Wireless Communications: Resource Management, Performance Analysis and Trajectory Optimization*](PhD_Thesis), while that of my MEng is [*On Enhancing Secrecy Performance for Wireless Communications via Artificial Noise*](MEng_Thesis). Note that the aforementioned performance optimisation and analysis for wireless transmission networks are conducted on **Python** and **MATLAB**, with the help of cutting-edge quantum-aided deep reinforcement learning and conventional mathematical techniques, respectively. -->

<!--My current research interests include 6G networks, cloud radio access networks (C-RANs), distributed ultra-large-scale MIMO, fronthaul quantization, radio resource management, IoT, UAV, deep reinforcement learning and quantum AI.
